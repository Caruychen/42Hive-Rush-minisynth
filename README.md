# Minisynth

This project was developed with Rust for the Hive Rush project.

To install on your computer, if not already installed, visit https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started and follow the instructions  there.

You should then be able to execute the run.sh shell script, that will build and test against a sample file.

Otherwise, we have submitted a binary already to  be executed (hopefully that works, otherwise, you can compile)
